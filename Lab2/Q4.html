            CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including 
            <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_layout'>layout</a>, 
            <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color'>colors</a>, 
            and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface'>fonts</a>. 
            This separation can improve content <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility'>accessibility</a>;
            provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple 
            <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page'>web pages</a> to share formatting by 
            specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the 
            structural content; and enable the .css file to be <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)'>cached</a> 
            to improve the page load speed between the 
            pages that share the file and its formatting.</br></br>

            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in 
            different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice 
            (via speech-based browser or <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader'>screen reader</a>), 
            and on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_display'>Braille-based</a> tactile devices. 
            CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a 
            <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device'>mobile device</a>.</br></br>

            The name <i>cascading</i> comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies
            if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
