            I have tried so hard to get you that every being has conspired to bring us together. 
            They say that if you wish for something from your heart, the entire universe will try to get it for you. 
            Today all of you have brought me together with my love. Thank you very much. 
            I feel like I am the king of the world. Today, my friends, I am convinced that our real lives are like our films, 
            where everything ends on a positive note. Happy endings. And if everything does not turn out well in the end,
            then that is not the end, there is more to the movie.

            If you walk on the wrong path ...</br>
            then may be in the start you'll get a lot of success and happiness ...</br>
            but in the end you'll lose ...</br>
            and if you walk on the right path ...</br>
            then may be in the start you'll get rejections on every step, you'll face issues and problems ...</br>
            but in the end you'll always win
        </p>
        <p class=speech3>
            In life if you want to become something, achieve something, win something ...</br>
            then always listen to your heart ...</br>
            and if your heart doesn't reply to you</br>
            then close your eyes and take the name of your mom and dad ...</br>
            then see you will achieve everything, everything that is hard will become easy ...</br>
            victory will be yours, just yours
